Team: Dhanvi Ganti, Lakshana Viswa

• Initial decisions: Python
• Notes on your chosen internal architecture: Used Pandas library, used Dataframes mainly 
• Task log:

1. Deciding on the language/architecture/libraries - Dhanvi and Lakshana, 0.5 hrs 
2. Process input file and convert to dataframe - Lakshana, 1 hr (converting to correct datatypes and such)
3. Process student command - Lakshana, 0.5 hrs
4. Process teacher, grade, bus, info and quit commands - Dhanvi, 2 hrs

Testing notes: not many bugs found, just the occasional ones with an improper data type (comparing string to int). Overall, took probably <0.5 hrs for each of us.

• Final notes (anything else you want to share with me about your implementation)
We ended up choosing Pandas because of the ease of parsing and the multitude of functions available to process the input.
